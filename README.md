## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1) Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AI-in-Wastewater-Treatment.git
cd AI-in-Wastewater-Treatment
```

### 2) Environment (example)
- Python ‚â• 3.10
- Typical libs: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, jupyter, streamlit/pyqt (if GUIs are Python-based)
- MATLAB/Octave (if GUIs/models are MATLAB-based)

### 3) Run GUIs
See `Model Simulation GUIs code/` for instructions per GUI.
